# E-PRESCRIPTION

## About
E - Prescription is a web based application for use of doctors and other medically licensed professionals. With the help of our application, doctors can prescribe medicines to patients in a paper-free way.

The appointed doctor enters their own details and then the relevent details of the patient (Name, Age, Allergies, Weight). Once this is done, the mediines, their dosage and duration, et cetera is filled. The doctor also uploads a copy of their signature as a guarantee for the patient.
As the doctor submits this form, a downloadable copy of the prescription is available.

## Installation
No special commands needed; any code editor that can run HTML, CSS and PHP will be able to execute this file.
